## 👋 Hi, I’m Callum Bain, a Junior Data Engineer based in Derby, UK.

💡 After nearly a decade working in telecoms, I often found that the more access I had to data, the better I could troubleshoot, plan, and deliver work effectively. That insight sparked a deeper curiosity about how data moves, how it's stored, and how it can be transformed to support real-world decision-making. This led me to retrain through the Northcoders Data Engineering Bootcamp and pursue a new career in tech.

🛠️ I now work with tools like Python, PostgreSQL, AWS, and Terraform to build and manage data pipelines.

📦 I recently built an ETL pipeline using AWS and Terraform, gaining hands-on experience with services like Lambda, S3, and EventBridge (check it out below!).
